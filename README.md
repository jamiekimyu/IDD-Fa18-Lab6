# ChatBot

*A lab report by Jamie Yu*

## In this Report

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I made a bot that can help you with your travels and remind you to pack right for the weather! It does this by telling you how many days you have left until your trip (using moment.js library) and telling you to dress warmly, as well as other interactions.
